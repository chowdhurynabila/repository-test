              3 to 5 days Santorini is the top tourist destination in Greece and
              is world-famous for its unique natural beauty. The caldera with
              the white villages on top, the sunken volcano, and the charming
              sunset make it a popular place for vacation. In brief, we
              recommend staying 3 to 5 days in order to visit as many places as
              possible.

          <h2>A Simple Perfect Place <br />To Get Lost</h2>
          <p>
            In order to cope with being lost in a foreign country, first, you
            need to be able to take control of the situation. Here are the
            things you should prepare:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Before you travel to places, get familiar with the map of the
              area. You should know which direction is north or south at all
              times, so you know that you are heading in the right direction.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have Google Maps installed on your smartphone, make sure to
              download an offline map of the area to your phone so you can use
              it on the go.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have Google Translate installed, make sure you have
              downloaded an offline pack of the language you are translating to,
              so you can communicate better with the locals.
